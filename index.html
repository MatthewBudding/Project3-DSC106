    <h3>Write Up:</h3>
    <div class = "writeup">
        <p>
        Our project set out to explore how male and female mice differ in both temperature and activity levels over the course of a day.
         To do this, we chose heatmaps as our central visualization tool because they let us pack an entire day-by-day, hour-by-hour 
         story into a single, easy-to-read chart. We plotted days on the vertical axis and hours on the horizontal axis, then used 
         color to signal the intensity of either temperature or activity. For the activity heatmaps, we opted for a purple-green-yellow 
         range so that high activity levels pop out in bright yellow, while calm or resting periods remain in cool purples. 
         For temperature, we wanted to preserve a sense of warmth in higher readings, so we shifted to a more classic black-red-yellow 
         gradient.
        </p>
        <p>
        Alongside color choices, we emphasized interactivity. Hover tooltips, for instance, give a precise value for each day-hour cell,
         helping viewers drill down beyond the overall trends. Those tooltips also highlight corresponding cells in the other sex's 
         heatmap, while showing the difference between the two values. The user could also filter by a range of values by brushing over 
         the legend.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our collaboration relied on dividing tasks among team members. One person cleaned and organized the mouse data, making sure the
         timestamps and values aligned properly across days, which took around 5 hours. 
         Two members spent roughly 10 person-hours building the two visualizations—fine-tuning colors, adding hover elements, and 
         experimenting with small design touches—then used another 4 hours to polish labels, legends, and other interface details. 
         My role was to write this narrative, drawing together all the design choices and findings, which took about two to three hours. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The final heatmaps highlight interesting differences between male and female mice. Both groups exhibit somewhat consistent 
         circadian rhythms, with elevated activity prior to the twelth hour. However, female mice showed sharp spikes in 
         both activity and temperature in days 2, 6, 10, and 14, corresponding to their estrus period. Other insights from this show 
         that males tend to exhibit more activity than female mice (except during estrus), but female mice consistently have higher tempereratures.
