        Our project set out to explore how male and female mice differ in both temperature and activity levels over the course of a day.
         To do this, we chose heatmaps as our central visualization tool because they let us pack an entire day-by-day, hour-by-hour 
         story into a single, easy-to-read chart. We plotted days on the vertical axis and hours on the horizontal axis, then used 
         color to signal the intensity of either temperature or activity. For the activity heatmaps, we opted for a purple–green–yellow 
         range so that high activity levels pop out in bright yellow, while calm or resting periods remain in cool purples. 
         For temperature, we wanted to preserve a sense of warmth in higher readings, so we shifted to a more classic blue–green–yellow 
         gradient.<br>
        Alongside color choices, we emphasized interactivity. Hover tooltips, for instance, give a precise value for each day-hour cell,
         helping viewers drill down beyond the overall trends. We also considered adding a filter so that users could zoom in on specific
         date ranges, though our demo defaults to displaying all available days. We weighed other chart types—like line charts or grouped
         bar charts—but ultimately, those would have lost the granularity that heatmaps retain so well.	<br>
        Our collaboration relied on dividing tasks among team members. One person cleaned and organized the mouse data, making sure the
         timestamps and values aligned properly across days, which took around eight person-hours. 
         Two members spent roughly twelve person-hours building the visualizations—fine-tuning colors, adding hover elements, and 
         experimenting with small design touches—then used another six hours to polish labels, legends, and other interface details. 
         My role was to write this narrative, drawing together all the design choices and findings, which took about two to three hours. <br>
        The final heatmaps highlight interesting differences between male and female mice. Both groups exhibit somewhat consistent 
         circadian rhythms, with elevated activity in the early and late hours of the day. However, we see that female mice typically
         maintain higher or more stable temperatures, especially in the morning, whereas males experience more pronounced dips or 
         fluctuations in the afternoon and evening. The data also suggests that while both sexes have activity spikes, these bursts can
         appear at different times or intensities from day to day. By blending color-coding, time axes, and interactivity, we’ve 
         created a clear, comprehensive visual tool for comparing these daily fluctuations in temperature and activity. Ultimately,
         this design provides a straightforward way to spot patterns and glean insights from a complex dataset—precisely what we set 
         out to do when we first formulated our research question.
